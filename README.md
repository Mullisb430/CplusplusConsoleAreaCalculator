# CplusplusConsoleAreaCalculator
Console interface program that calculates and displays the area of a circle, square, rectangle, when you enter data about that shape. This was created for a school project.
The main app file can be ran on Max, and it will open your terminal and run the program, else you can open the .cpp file in a text editor and run it that way.
